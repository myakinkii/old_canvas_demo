# some old canvas demo

This was created back in 2008. Good old vanilla JS.

SPA approach I use here in Basic.js was about to evolve into render.js 'framework' I used later (eg in minesnf client)

Most likely own ajax implementation was stolen from some book like 'Ajax in action' or some other one I literally had in paper...
